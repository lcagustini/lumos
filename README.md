This a GBA game made in 24 hours during Meeting Jam 2019 at Unicamp.  
The game portraits Larry Foster, Ronaldo and Lorraine on their quest through a dark maze, where they need to drain light from candles to gain power, however this makes the mazer even darker...

The game was developed entirely in C and spaghetti.  
One may compile it by having ([devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman)) and running:
```
make
```
To run it, just use your emulator of choice, or a real GBA.
